# Application-of-Data-Analysis
This is the university course, which covered different real dataset such as biosignal(pain assessement), metal icon prediction
in water, spatial data,etc. The main idea behind the course was to evaludate the machine learning model by appling the suitable
cross-validation methods based on the data. The cross-validations such as, leave-three-out (data set consiting three replicas), leave-subject-out(biosignal data), spatial CV(spatial dataset), etc. 
were applied.
