# Application-of-Data-Analysis
This is the university course, which covered 5 different real dataset such as 1) metal icon prediction in water, 2) bio-signal data (for pain assessment), 3) spatial data (soil water permeability), 4)symmetric pair-input data (protein-protien interaction) and  5) No-signal data. 

The main idea behind the course was to evaluate the machine learning model by appling the suitable cross-validation methods as per the nature of the dataset. The cross-validations methods such as, leave-three-out (data set consiting three replicas), leave-subject-out(for biosignal data), spatial CV( for spatial dataset), modified-version of CV  (for symetric input-pair data) and permutation test (for no-sginal data) were applied.
